[33m4512531[m feat: Refactor navigation and UI for better UX - **Auto-navigation on Deletion**: The detail page now automatically pops when its underlying data is deleted, preventing users from being stranded. - **Centralized URL Logic**: URL launching functionality has been refactored into a dedicated LinkLauncher service to reduce code duplication. - **Decluttered AppBar**: The theme toggle and about buttons have been moved from the AppBar to a new SettingsPage to ensure the main title is always fully visible. - **Improved Drawer Layout**: The Logout button is now anchored to the bottom of the navigation drawer using a Spacer, improving visual organization.
