<h1 align="center"> A Plant Disease Detector App based on Nested Transfer Learning </h1>
<p align="center">
The objective of the project is to identify plant disease by using image of a plant leaf using deep learning model. Currently 5 Plants are supported Apple, Corn, Orange, Potato and Tomato. The Whole project has four components:- <a href = "https://github.com/spsaswat/plantdis/tree/main/ipynb">Deep Learning</a>(Using Tensorflow), <a href = "https://github.com/spsaswat/plantdis/tree/main/mlhub">Command Line Interaction</a>(Using ML-HUB), <a href = "https://github.com/spsaswat/plantdis/tree/main/plantdis_flutter">Linux Desktop App</a>(MLHUB backend), and <a href = "https://github.com/spsaswat/plantdis/tree/main/plantdis_mob">Android App</a>(Tflite backend). This project was initially started as a requirement of the course COM4560(ANU), under the supervision of Prof. <a href = "https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/graham-williams">Graham Williams</a>.
